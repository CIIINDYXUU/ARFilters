# CIS 099 Independent Study: An Exploration into Augmented Reality Development Tools

This semester, I underwent an independent study teaching myself AR filter development using state-of-the-art AR development toolkits, specifically using Tiktok and Snap Inc.'s proprietary software. I explored the possibilities of AR development in Effect House (by Tiktok) and Lens Studio (Snap Inc.) to learn more about the AR pipeline and the capabilities of these tools for AR content creation. Over the course of few months I developed 6 AR effects total, 3 within each software.

## Introduction

Since its advent in the late 1960s, augmented reality (AR), an immersive technology that allows users to interact with digital objects projected onto the real world, has reshaped the ways in which we consume and interact with digital content. In recent years, interest in AR technology has surged, captivating audiences across various industries with its ability to blend digital with physical. As technological advancements in AR software and hardware, such as Apple's Vision Pro headset, become more mainstream, there exists an exciting opportunity for engineers, researchers, designers, and developers to build AR-based applications and solutions for the masses. AR provides countless affordances in visualization, interaction, and immersion, and presents unique solutions for an array of different industries, particular regarding entertainment and content creation. 

As augmented reality technology continues to gain traction and become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, there is a growing need for individuals with expertise in AR development and design. Over the past decade, more and more tools for AR development have also become more accessible to the public. Two leading players in the AR content creation industry are Tiktok and Snapchat, both platforms that allow their users to create and share original AR filters and effects. From interactive games to beauty filters to new AI and ML-based features, the possibilites for creation are endless.

### Objective
The objective of this independent study is to delve deeper into augmented reality development, gaining a comprehensive understanding of existing state-of-the-art AR toolkits and the AR development pipeline. The projects developed over the course of the semester will be multidisciplinary, requiring a combined foundation of artistic intuition, computer graphics knowledge, and software development skills. 

The initial plan was to learn three different softwares: Tiktok's Effect House, Meta's Spark AR, and Unity's AR Foundation, buildling 2-3 AR experiences each. However, early on in the semester I quickly realized this plan was overambitious and decided to rescope from breadth to depth. This study explores AR development in Tiktok's Effect House and Snap Inc.'s Lens Studio, with the goal of delving deeper into each software's capabilities. I ended up creating 6 experiences overall, 3 per software. The following list covers the range of AR features and types of effects I was able to explore in the semester:
- Effect House (Tiktok)
  - World AR
  - Interactive Gaming
  - Real-time Physics
  - Head Tracking
  - Face Filters
- Lens Studio (Snap Inc.)
  - Interactive Shaders and Post-Processing
  - Volumetric Rendering
  - Hand Tracking
  - VFX

### Timeline

Upon rescoping the project from the initial plan, I restructured my timeline to the following:
